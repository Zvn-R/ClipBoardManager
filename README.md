# ClipBoardManager
A clipboard manager for MacOS. 

**This is going to be my first real coding project and my first ever experience developing an application for MacOS and using Swift as a programming language.*

# Goals

I am going to be undertaking this project because the  built in clipboard manager is highly underwhelming and coming from windows it has been really annoying to not be able to copy multiple things. I decided to solve this problem and hopefully gain an insight into the work flow of an actual developer.

I aim to learn: 
	•	macOS system programming 
	•	Swift programming 
	•	AppKit or SwiftUI 
	•	Software design 
	•	Packaging and distribution
